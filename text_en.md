# 0Letter of application

It is 2020, why apply for a job with a standard Word or PDF document?

I am an experienced Front-End Developer, thus my letter of application should reflect that.

Why wait till a job-interview only to find out your (company) Technology Vision does not match mine?

## 0"*You can't teach an old dog new tricks*"
But that doesn't mean the dog is mentally dead. Some old dogs are very capable of learning new tricks **without** a teacher.  

I am one of those dogs that started with Internet development in 1990,  
Yes, there was an Internet before the Web took over in the mid 90s.  

And I haven't stopped learning new tricks since.

### 0Digital video & E-learning

My first experiments with digital video started in 1993  
I had joined the Hogeschool Utrecht R&D Department as New Media/E-Learning Developer in 1990 as employee #2

From 1991 to 1993 we had leased so many PCs to (wealthier part-time) students, IBM graciously donated 100.000 guilders to be spent on IBM technologies.  
And I was the lucky guy to decide what to buy. For a 23 year old it felt like Christmas, Santa-Claus and 23 birthdays came on one day.
Mind you, the digitizing station was 55.000 and a touch-screen monitor 18.000

#### 02000 - The Web didn't do video, CD-roms ruled and video with it.

Of course those early projects were all about CD-rom, Internet just did not have enough bandwidth.  
For us Internet pioneers the WWW was a technology we mastered and used on-the-side.

Later, as an independent contractor in the Macromedia world I worked on big projects for <a href="https://creapolis.nl/" target="_new">Creapolis</a>

#### 0Award winning CD-rom loaded with video

At the New York Multimedia Festival in **2000** the *Ministerie van Justitie VisieKubus over Integriteit* CD-rom won silver

#### 0Video killed the radio star

So the Web killed CD-rom, Adobe killed Macromedia and Steve Jobs killed Flash. 

Youtube (2005) came on the scene, and truly interactive video (still only possible off-line) was dead.

I changed my job title from *Multimedia Developer* to **Front-End Developer**

### 0CTO

I rose through the ranks, mainly in the Microsoft domain, by 2010 I was CTO of a midsize organisation.  

Suit, tie, endless MT meetings, the lot

And I soon felt as misserable as I had never felt.  The only joy coaching interns on their Front-End development jobs.

The decision was easy: quit, start contracting in the (Microsoft) Front-End world again.

### 0last 10 years

I have tried multiple Start-Ups to learn I do not have enough CEO skills to succeed.

I just love scripting

My last work with digital video, now fully interactive and running from a website, goes back some to September 2013.
http://engelman.nl/sites/csi365/video.html

But, at that time, still impossible to run on all Browsers. Only now Microsoft has released the New Edge Browser (based on the Chromium engine) in january the Web world is ready for highly interactive videos.

#### 0I am not a Video Editor

I fully understand what is involved with Video Editting, the techniques, the story telling.

I did some editting back in 2011 for my Motorclub... shot with a 25$ camera!

Am especially proud (remember, I am not a Editor) of the 'Screw Driver' (my favourite drink is a wodka-jus) montage I did in reaction to the Ice Bucket Hype

## 0An experienced dog in the Front-End world

In 26 years Web Development I have seen many techologies come and go.

Including many *Old ideas parading as new ones* (Dutch: *Oude wijn in nieuwe zakken*)

#### Everything good becomes a standard... eventually

jQuery immediatly comes to mind. I have used it since its first release in 2006

Since 2011 (IE9 released) [jQuery goodies are available as W3C standard JavaScript technologies](https://blog.garstasio.com/you-dont-need-jquery/) or can be polyfilled. So any architect planning a new project should make a conscious decision on using the 90KB jQuery library or not.

But standardization takes time, because it means Browser vendors like Apple, Google, Mozilla have to agree. And alas they often disagree for many years.

Enter the new jQuery-ies:

#### 0Frameworks

Angular was the first big impetus for *Component Based Development*. Later React and Vue (and dozens others) jumped on the bandwagon.

It gave Developers more power; on the other hand we have to agree that __*creating a Web Page*__ was no longer as easy as opening a Text-editor and typing some HTML...  
<span class="important">which was the whole reason why Tim Berners-Lee WWW became so popular in the first place!</span>

Git, Node, Gulp, Babel, WebPack and other secondary tools required, make "Front-End" something for Rocket-Scientist. The [Npm vs Yarn](https://www.ryadel.com/en/yarn-vs-npm-pnpm-2019/) debate clearly shows "We" Front-End Developers have become so focussed on **Tooling**, we sometimes forget it is about the to be delivered **Product**.  

Or wait... 2020 brought us [RomeJS](https://romejs.dev/).. the *Everything-in-One* tool from FaceBook.

#### The Browser war is over

Microsoft Security Chief Chris Jackson already [advocated in March 2019](https://www.zdnet.com/article/microsoft-security-chief-ie-is-not-a-browser-so-stop-using-it-as-your-default/) NOT to use Internet Explorer anymore.  
In january 2020 Microsoft released the [new Edge](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/edge) built on top of the Chromium engine.

That means all major Browsers (Chrome, Edge, FireFox, Safari) now [support the modern ESx JavaScript standard](https://kangax.github.io/compat-table/es2016plus/)

#### The W3C Custom Elements API/Web Components standard


Eager to always learn new technologies I of course was one of the first to jump on the Framework
